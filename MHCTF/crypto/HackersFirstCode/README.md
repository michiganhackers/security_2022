Idea

Wanted to make a very easy and basic cryptography flag. 

Solution

First open up the python code and recognize that it is a very basic substituiton cypher.  The 
output of the cypher is Startingpoint.txt.  By looking at what substitutions are made by encode.
py one can take every letter of the output and reverse it through the scypher to get the flag.
