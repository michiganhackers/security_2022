## Idea

\<Using the enigma machine to decipher https://www.dcode.fr/enigma-machine-cipher\>

## Solution

\<Part 1: Decoding the first part involves using a shift cipher of 5, because the encrypted text is long enough this can be done automatically on most websites. For the next part you have to realize with the "WW two" hint that this is the encoding/decoding instructions for the enigma machine. "Kreigs 3" is the machine type of kreigsmarine 3, I, II, II are the rotors to mount, C is the reflector to mount, A, B, B is the initial positions of rotors, A, A, B is the positions of the alphabet ring, and the dashes are the plug board configuration.\>
