## Flag

\<MHCTF{YOU_DID_IT_SHEEESH!}\>

## Idea

\<All the letters in the flag will be shifted one space to the right on the physical keybaord. If the letter is the right-most letter, it will become the left-most letter in that row. Punctuation is kept normal. For example, "Hello World" will be "JRAAP EPTAF". \>

## Solution

\<Use control + F in the text file to find the flag with {}. Then, decrypt.\>
