## Idea

All of the letters will be shifted by 17 based off of 1817 when the University of Michigan was founded. Using a basic shift-cipher to last line of the chorus in Mr. Brightside. There will be a hint: "We may be an old university, but our school spirit will never die!"

## Solution

Either use brute force to try different shifts or try to figure out the key from the hint.
